# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented below.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Marketing landing page** — new `website/` directory (Vite + React 19 + Framer Motion 12 + Tailwind 3) with a redesigned hero, features grid, architecture diagram, terminal demo, metrics, tech stack, use cases, docs preview, changelog timeline, FAQ accordion, and CTA panel. Liquid-glass surfaces, animated orb background, custom dark palette (purple / pink / cyan / green / yellow), and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- **Multi-platform adapter gateway** — `src/adapters/` now ships with Discord, Slack, SMS (Twilio), Voice (Twilio), WhatsApp, Email (Nodemailer), Webhook, and Bot-Commands adapters behind a single `gateway.ts` interface. Includes 4 adapter test files (gateway, sms, whatsapp, hmac).
- **HMAC-signed REST API** — `src/api/hmac.ts` with timing-safe comparison, replay-protection window, and a `hmac.test.ts` covering sign / verify / replay / tampering cases.
- **New AI providers** — Mistral, Azure OpenAI, and Together AI are now first-class in `src/ai/providers.ts`, with a `providers.test.ts` smoke test.
- **Test framework migration** — agent / audit / bench / chat / cron / harness / mcp / memory / mesh / sandbox / tools / vault suites migrated from `test-*.ts` to `*.test.ts` naming so they run under `bun test --coverage` and Codecov. New tests added: planner, ratchet, supervisor, runtime, docker / filesystem / process (sandbox), runner, reporter, embedding, computer, rbac.
- **GitHub Actions coverage reporting** — `ci.yml` runs `bun test --coverage` and uploads to Codecov with a `dashboard` flag for vitest output.
- **`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-cost-attribution-design.md`** — design spec for Sprint 17 (cost attribution & agent benchmarking), tracking real implementation that replaces the stubbed `src/billing/tracker.ts` and `src/telemetry/cost.ts`.

### Changed

- `tsconfig.json` now excludes `website/` from the root `tsc --noEmit` (the website has its own `tsconfig.app.json`); the pre-commit hook runs both typechecks in sequence.
- `.husky/pre-commit` runs `bunx tsc --noEmit` (root) **and** `bunx tsc -b` (website) so both projects stay clean.
- Dashboard files were refactored from `dashboard/src/site/*.tsx` to `dashboard/src/site/components/` to keep imports relative now that they mirror the website's component layout.
- README and `ROADMAP.md` updated to mention the website, the adapter gateway, and the upcoming v0.6.0+ vision.

### Removed

- Runtime SQLite databases (`data/audit/*.db*`, `data/telemetry/*.db*`, `data/experience/*.db*`) and ephemeral state directories (`.aegis/`, `.superpowers/`, `.commandcode/`, `.worktrees/`) are now gitignored — they are runtime state, not source.
- Test stub utilities (`src/utils/doSomething.ts`, `greet.ts`, `hello.ts`), the one-time `copy-site.js` script, and the top-level `task.md` / `implementation_plan.md` planning artifacts are no longer tracked.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Auto-generated docs source** — `scripts/extract-commands.ts` parses `src/cli/commands/*.ts` via the TypeScript Compiler API and emits `shared/commands.json` (128 commands as of this write). The dashboard and website docs sections now consume this file as a single source of truth instead of hand-maintained command arrays. New scripts: `bun run docs:generate` / `bun run docs:check`. `pretest` runs `docs:check` to fail CI on drift.
- **Generator test suite** — `scripts/__tests__/extract-commands.test.ts` with 3 fixture files (`simple.ts`, `with-options.ts`, `with-subcommands.ts`) covering simple chains, alias/description/options/defaults, and parent+subcommand extraction. All 3 tests pass; the test is registered in `scripts/run-tests.ts`.
- **Dashboard docs layer** — `dashboard/src/data/commandGroups.ts` derives 11 hand-curated groups (system, setup, agents, orchestration, memory, knowledge, schedule, serve, adapters, sessions, runtime) from `shared/commands.json` and adds icon/tag metadata. `dashboard/src/routes/Docs.tsx` now imports this layer; the hand-maintained `commandGroups` array is gone.
- **Website docs layer** — `website/src/data/docTopics.ts` exposes `navGroups`, `docTopics`, and `defaultTopic` (15 curated topics) sourced from `shared/commands.json` via a `row(name)` helper that resolves command descriptions from the JSON. `website/src/sections/DocsSection.tsx` now imports this layer; the hand-maintained `navGroups` / `docContent` / `defaultContent` constants are gone.
- **Design spec** — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-docs-section-update-design.md` captures the contract: schema, file layout, CI wiring, risks, migration plan.
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with `oven/bun:1-slim` production image, HEALTHCHECK, non-root user
- `docker-compose.yml` with named volume, env passthrough, and dashboard-dev profile (Vite HMR)
- `.dockerignore` with comprehensive exclusion rules
- **AES-256-GCM vault encryption**: `src/vault/crypto.ts` with key management (`AEGIS_VAULT_KEY` env var or auto-generated `~/.aegis/.vault-key`), auto-migration from legacy `vault.json`, no plaintext fallback
- **Structured logger** (`src/cli/logger.ts`): levels, JSON output in non-TTY, pretty-print in TTY, module-scoped instances, writes to stderr
- **Error boundaries** (`src/cli/guard.ts`): `registerErrorBoundaries()` for `unhandledRejection` + `uncaughtException`
- **Graceful shutdown** (`index.ts`): SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers with agent cleanup via `agentManager.destroy()`
- **Zod config validation** (`src/config.ts`): `validateConfig()` with field-level salvage on invalid config
- **API hardening** (`src/api/server.ts`): CORS with configurable origins, rate limiting (100/min), input validation, security headers
- **Unit test suites**:
  - `src/memory/test-memory-system.ts` — 33 tests: init, user profile CRUD, daily logs, auto memories, fact extraction, search, context building
  - `src/memory/test-vector.ts` — 21 tests: add, search, category, stats, remove, edge cases
  - `src/memory/test-session-store.ts` — 13 tests: CRUD, rename, export, agent traces
  - `src/agent/test-engine.ts` — 85 assertions: IPC handling, hooks, kill, routing, events, listing
- **Architecture documentation**: agent system, memory system, sandbox system deep-dives
- **Developer guides**: creating modes, tools, and agent types step-by-step
- **REST API reference**: all endpoints with examples, validation rules, error codes
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `SECURITY.md` files

### Changed
- `dashboard/src/routes/Docs.tsx` — no longer hardcodes 13 stale command groups; renders directly from the generated JSON via `dashboard/src/data/commandGroups.ts`.
- `website/src/sections/DocsSection.tsx` — no longer hand-maintains 16 marketing copy blocks; renders from `website/src/data/docTopics.ts`. The "Reflection loop" topic no longer references the non-existent `aegis agent-run --ratchet` flag; "Provenance" topic is gone (no `provenance` command exists).
- `dashboard/tsconfig.json` and `website/tsconfig.app.json` — added `resolveJsonModule: true` so both can import `shared/commands.json`.
- `scripts/run-tests.ts` — registers the new docs generator test before the integration tests.
- `src/vault/manager.ts` — vault serialized as encrypted blob (`vault.enc`), auto-migrates from legacy `vault.json`, removes stale plaintext
- `src/cli/commands/config.ts` — shows `vault.enc` path and "AES-256-GCM encrypted" in status
- `README.md` — added Docker usage section with build/run/compose commands and security notes
- `docker-compose.yml` — removed deprecated `version` field
